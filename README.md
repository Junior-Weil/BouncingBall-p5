For this program in p5js I edited Prof. Meng's program and made the prject very interesting.  
I made the text box slowly change colors every time it is hit with a ball as well as flash.  Then I made the balls double in speed on the horizontal
axis everytime they hit the txt box and go half as fast when moving on the verticle axis.  here is the link to the code https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/2d1U_D7rw
